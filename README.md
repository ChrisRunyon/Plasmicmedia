This is the source code for Plasmicmedia.com.
This code is not reusable.

This code is difficult to work with and 
it is difficult to debug by design 
to prevent code theft and stealing of intellectual property.

When using a browser and "view source" you will only see partial HTML. 

When making modifications the page will not render properly.

This is engineered by design.

This means you can not cheat and edit the code and view your changes in a browser for development. 

To use this code you must know how to code as a Software Engineer.
